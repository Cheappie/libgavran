== Raw data containers

|=== 
| Data Type    | Container
| Write cost   | O(1)
| Lookup cost  | O(1), using opaque handle from write
| Data type    | Arbitrary binary data
| Maximum size | Unlimited
| Iteration    | Arbitrary order (unrelated to handle value)
|===

We built a hash table in the previous chapter, which will allow us to lookup a `uint64_t` value using a `uint64_t` key. If this is all we ever want to do, that is fine, but in
practice, we need to deal with more complex data. 
The API we have to deal with _arbitrary data_ right now in Gavran is fairly poor, in terms of what it can offer us. We have pages, and that is pretty much it. That doesn't 
work very  well when we deal with arbitrary data, we need some better way to handle it. After thinking about it for quite a bit, I came up with the most minimal set of API that 
I could think of for managing arbitrary data in Gavran, shown in <<container_api>>.

[source]
[[container_api]]
.`gavran/db.h` - API for CRUD operations on arbitrary data 
----
include::../include/gavran/db.h[tags=container_api]
----

The code in <<container_api>> expose two new primitives that we'll be able to make use of. There is the _Container_ and the _Container Item_. You can think about a container as 
simply a grouping of values. Gavran makes no requirements about the structure or shape of the values. You may have a single container and dump all the items there or multiple 
containers. The key here is that once you have a container you can place items in it. An item is simply a piece of data that is stored by Gavran. Again, we make no requirement 
on its shape, form or size. The latter is important, since it means that we'll need to support items of any size, including those that span multiple pages.

Let's look at how we can use the API usage in <<remember_item>>, here we are storing a JSON string inside Gavran. The container was already previously allocated and we are
creating a new write transaction to store the JSON to the container, returning the new item id back to the caller.

[source]
[[remember_item]]
.`test.c` - Using the container API to store an item
-----
include::./code/test.c[tags=remember_item]
-----

In <<remember_item>>, we can see that we simply call `container_item_put()` to add an item, and then we get an `item_id` value, which we could later use to get the item back. 
We have a simple way to recall items, using _opaque_ ids. With the API and its usage in place, let's talk a bit about what kind of promises we are going to give to
the user.

* A container is expected to be a very long lived object. It is similar to a table in a relational database. Something that you create once and use for many times afterward. 
* An item id should allow us to access the item's content with `O(1)` cost.
* The item id is going to remain stable for the life time of the item.

This means that given an item id, we can very quickly get to the item's data and that we can rely on the item's id not changing behind our back. That means that we can store
that id and reuse it later. Given just the API we have seen so far, we have enough for basic CRUD operations. But how does this work? Let's look at things in order, we have
the `container_create()` function, where it all starts, in <<container_create>>.

[source]
[[container_create]]
.`container.c` - Creating a new container 
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_create]
-----

The `container_create()` allocates a single page and setup its metadata, the metadata for a container page is using the `container_page_t` struct and it is shown in 
<<container_page_t>>. This is used to manage a container and its items, as we'll shortly see.
You can also see in <<container_page_t>> that we are starting to use Gavran to implement itself. The container has a `free_list`, to manage its free list. We'll
discuss this in detail later on in this chapter. What is important is that this is actually a hash table, the same one that we implemented in the last chapter. 
Things are starting to click into place, I'm very happy to say.

.`gavran/db.h` - The metadata of a container page
-----
include::../include/gavran/db.h[tags=container_page_t]
-----

Looking at the structure in <<container_page_t>> it may not be obvious how everything plays together, so let's look <<container-page>> to see how the container
is actually structured. This is the first time that we see interesting use of the page's metadata. Pretty much _all_ the interesting details about the container
page are actually being manage from its metadata. 

[[container-page]]
.The structure of a single page in a container
image::container-page.png[]

A container page is meant to contain items, that is why it is named this way. An item can be of any size and we want to pack as many items as possible into a page
to allow for greater density. That means that we need to somehow _manage_ the items inside a page. This is done using the `floor` and `ceiling` fields in the 
`container_page_t` structure. 

=== Writing an item

The idea is that when we want to write an item to the page, we'll write it to the _top_ of the page. To write an item that is 64 bytes on a page, we'll lower the
`ceiling` by 64 bytes and then write 64 bytes from the new `ceiling` position toward the old value. After writing the item, we aren't done. We need some way
to _refer_ to the item. We could use the offset inside the page, but that has its own issues. In particular, we'll likely need to defrag the page at some point,
which will require us to move the items around. If we use the offset in the page as the id of the item, we'll need to change the id. We want to avoid that.

Instead, we'll write the offset of the item into the `floor` of the page. We consider the bottom of the page as an array of `int16_t`, containing the offsets
of the item in the page. Whenever we have a new item, we'll raise the `floor` by another 2 bytes (the size of `int16_t`) and place the offset of the item in
the new position. The id of the item in this case is the index into this array of positions at the bottom of the page. 

In other words, we place the actual value of an item on the top, growing down and we set the position of the item in the page at the bottom, growing up. A page
is considered full when the `ceiling` and the `floor` meet. It might be easier to understand how this work if we'll look at <<container_add_item_to_page>>.
The caller of `container_add_item_to_page()` is responsible for making sure that there is enough space in the page for adding the item. 

[source]
[[container_add_item_to_page]]
.`container.c` - Adding an item to a page
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_add_item_to_page]
-----

In `container_add_item_to_page()` we start by getting the container page's metadata as well as the page itself ready for modifications. We then scan the bottom
of the page looking for an empty index in the `int16_t* positions` array. If we can't find one, we'll increase the size of the `positions` array by incrementing
the `floor` field on the metadata.

.Working with raw memory
****
One of the things that we'll run into over and over again when implementing persistent data structures is that we give meaning to certain parts of memory
without bothering to go through any sort of structure or API. We have the raw memory of the container page, and we decide that we are going to treat the 
start of the page as an array of `int16_t`. At the same time, at the end of the page, we are working with raw bytes. 

We also allow ourselves to do extend an array, which is not something that you'll typically see in C. This is because we are working at a lower level than usual.
It may take a bit of time to get used to the way we look at a piece of memory first as a raw set of bytes and then as an array or a struct. Note that unsaid but
very important is the notion of alignment. 

We are making sure that our accesses are either properly aligned or going through the proper channels to ensure that we'll not have to deal with alignment issues.
****

Once we have the index where the position of the value will go, we need to put the value itself in its place. Beside the item's value, we also need to keep its 
size. We handle that using `varint`, which we covered in the last chapter. 
The last action of `container_add_item_to_page()` is to record the position of the item in the `positions` array and then compute the new `item_id`. 

The `item_id` computation is interesting. We use the `page_num` and the `index` to generate the `item_id`. Let's dig deeper into what is going on in the last 
part of `container_add_item_to_page()`. When _reading_ an item, we'll need to find it with `O(1)` cost. Ideally, we'll want the cost to be similar to just a 
pointer dereference. 

We achieve this goal by encoding the `page_num` in the `item_id`. What we are _actually_ doing by multiplying the `page_num` by `PAGE_SIZE`? That actually 
give us the offset of the page in _bytes_. The `index`, on the other hand, is known to be a maximum of 4095. It is an index into an `int16_t` array whose size 
is a maximum of 8192 bytes, after all. We're adding `1` to the value for reasons that we'll be made clear shortly. With the `item_id` in the shape that it is,
we can easily get to the relevant page, find the position of the item _within_ the page and return the results to the user.

Looking back at the requirements we have for storing items, we have:

* An `item_id` providing `O(1)` access time, we achieve that by packing both the `page_num` and the `index` into a single `uint64_t`.
* An `item_id` should remain stable for the life time of the item, we achieve that by returning not the position of the item in the page, but using indirection
  through the `positions` array. We can change the actual location of the item in the page without affecting its id. 

The `container_add_item_to_page()` function is called under a number of assumptions that I want to call out explicitly:

* The item's size is small enough to fit in a page, I defined that as under 6KB.
* The page in question _has_ enough space between the `floor` and `ceiling` values to fit an item of the desired size.

There is quite a lot of machinery in place to ensure that these assumptions hold. Let's start with the first item in the list, how do we store an item that is too
big to be held in a page?

=== Writing a _large_ item

When we are writing small values, we want to place them in a container page, to get the maximum density. But an item can be of _any_ size, we want to support
storing of an item that is 20KB in size as well as an item that is 10MB in size. These do not fit in a page, so how do we deal with that? When we worked on the 
foundation of Gavran we implemented allocation strategies for pages, these are going to come in handy now. When we need to write an item whose size is too large
to a page, we'll allocate it in an _overflow_ page. 

An overflow page is a page (or a set of pages) that are dedicated to holding a single value. They have no structure of their own and simply hold their value. We
have actually mostly dealt with overflow pages up until this chapter whenever we wanted to store some data. Jumping forward a bit, in <<container_api>>
we have the `container_get_next()`. We need it to be able to iterate over all the items in a container. That is simple to do when the values are stored in the 
container's page, but how will we deal with large values?

The answer to that is simple, we'll store the large item _twice_. The first time, we'll store it in an overflow page, but we'll also store the page number of the
overflow page in the container page. This is a small value, so it fits very well and it gives us a very simple way to handle iteration of all the values in the 
container. 

You can see how we handle writing a large value to the container in <<container_item_put_large>>. I have defined large value as any value that exceeds 6KB in size.
The balance in here is between external and internal fragmentation. A value that is 5.9KB in size will be stored directly in the container page, but it means that
we can put only values that are much smaller. If there is a good mix of sizes, we'll likely get good density of values. On the other hand, an item that is 6.1 KB 
will have its own page, but we'll waste the rest of the page that is sitting empty.

[source]
[[container_item_put_large]]
.`container.c` - Adding a large item to a container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_put_large]
-----

We allocate space directly using `txn_allocate_page()` and then register the metadata as an `page_flags_overflow`. An overflow page has two interesting fields
in its metadata: `number_of_pages` and the `size_of_value`. The first is meant to record how many pages this value uses and the second what is the actual
size of the value. You can see that we use `TO_PAGES()` to go from the item's size to the number of pages it will use.
Gavran's overflow pages use `uint32_t` to store the number of pages, so a single overflow page can use a maximum of 32 TB. I think that this is large enough
that we don't really need to concern ourselves further with this detail. 

After we allocate the page, we copy the data from the item to the page's buffer and then we register the newly allocated page in the container. We encode
the overflow page number into a buffer and write _that_ to the container as well. You can see that we pass `true` to the `is_reference` flag of 
`container_item_allocate()`. We saw how that is used in `container_add_item_to_page()`. If the passed value is a reference, we store the position of the 
value in the `positions` array on the container's page using negative numbers. This is used as an indication later that this isn't the value itself but
a reference to it.

The final step in the `container_item_put_large()` is to compute the `item_id`. In the case of a large value, we use the `page_num` multiplied by `PAGE_SIZE`,
that gives us direct access to the page when we want to read. The `item_id` that is created from storing the page reference in the container is only used
to link the overflow page back to the container, we are never exposing this it to the outside world.

[TIP]
.The structure of the `item_id`
====
A large item will be stored on an overflow page and the value will be the `page_num * PAGE_SIZE`. A _small_ value, on the other hand, will be stored inside
a container page and the `item_id` will be the `page_num * PAGE_SIZE + index + 1`. The `+1` there is important. It ensures that we can tell at a glance 
whatever an `item_id` refers to a small or large item.

If the `item_id` is evenly divisible by `PAGE_SIZE`, that means that we are looking at an overflow page. If the `item_id` isn't divisible by `PAGE_SIZE`,
it means that we are looking at a small value and we can find the container page number using integer division and the index in the page using modulus on the
`PAGE_SIZE`. Because `0` is a valid index for a small item value, we increment that by one to ensure that there is no potential for confusion.
====

=== Allocating space for items

We looked into how we store large items to an overflow page and we saw the final step in adding small items to a container page. Let's see how the entire 
process works. We'll start at the top, with `container_item_put()`, shown on <<container_item_put>>.

[source]
[[container_item_put]]
.`container.c` - Entry point to adding a value to a container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=CONTAINER_ITEM_SMALL_MAX_SIZE]

include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_put]
-----

If the value is large, we'll call to `container_item_put_large()` to do its work. But small values are handled differently. We call to `container_item_allocate()`
to find the appropriate location for the value. An interesting note about this function is that it doesn't actually write the item's data. Instead, it gives us
the address where we can write the data. This allows us to allocate an item and write directly to that location, instead of having to store the data in some
temporary buffer and then have Gavran copy it. You can see the implementation of `container_item_allocate()` in <<container_item_allocate>>.

[source]
[[container_item_allocate]]
.`container.c` - Allocating space for a small item in the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_get_total_size]

include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_allocate]
-----

We are already familiar with `container_add_item_to_page()` function which is called in <<container_item_allocate>>. It does the work of actually adding the
item to the page. And `container_find_small_space_to_allocate()` role is find that space. You can also see in <<container_find_small_space_to_allocate>> the
`container_get_total_size()` function, used to compute how much space a small item will take. In addition to the raw size of the item, we have 2 bytes taken
by the `int16_t` value we use to store the position of the value as well as the encoded size of the item. 

This is pretty much it in terms of writing to the container, but there is still a big topic to cover. Space allocation _inside_ the container. 

=== Allocating space in the container

When we want to allocate a large item (greater than 6KB), we'll simply allocate the pages for it. This is easy and simple approach to dealing with the issue.
However, what happens when we have to deal with a smaller item? In this case, we want to place it inside a container page, the question is, _which_ container
page. 
A container starts out from a single page, but when it is full, we'll need to allocate more pages. And it is possible that some pages will have space while
some won't. What makes things more complex is that an item can be of any size. If we need to find space for an item that is `768` bytes in size, we may not
be able to find space for it in a particular page, but there is still enough space in that page to fit other, smaller values. 

We handle this using the `free_list`, which is actually a hash table. In this case, we aren't using it as a table, but as a hash set. We store in the keys
the page numbers of pages in the container that has free space available. When we need to allocate space in the container, we'll scan the hash table and 
try to find a page that has enough space for the current item that is being added. 
You can see how this is done on <<container_find_small_space_to_allocate>>.

[source]
[[container_find_small_space_to_allocate]]
.`container.c` - Find a container page that has enough space to add the current item
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_find_small_space_to_allocate]
-----

<<container_find_small_space_to_allocate>> starts by defining two `pages_map_t`. One (`pages`) is used to store the state of `hash_get_next()`, as we saw in 
the previous chapter. The other map we use it `to_remove`, which is not initialized at this point. We then start to scan over the `free_list`, finding each
container page in turn and checking it if is a good fit for the current item. This is done via `container_page_can_fit_item_size()`. You can check how this
is done in <<container_page_can_fit_item_size>>. 

If we have enough space, we can abort the search, do whatever cleanup is required and return. If we _can't_ find space in the page, we check if it is full. 
We define a page as full when its free space is too small to hold an item that is 125% of the average item size in the page. You can see how we compute the
average size of an item in a page in <<container_get_page_avg_item_size>>.

[source]
[[container_get_page_avg_item_size]]
.`container.c` - Computing the average size of an item in a page
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_get_page_avg_item_size]
-----

If the current page is too full to hold more entries we'll add it to the `to_remove` map and clean it after we exit the loop. 
This is done by `container_remove_full_pages()`, which will iterate over the `to_remove` map (if it was created) in order to remove full pages from the 
`free_list`. We have to do this in two stages because it isn't safe to iterate over the hash table while we are modifying it. 
Finally, if we were unable to find _any_ page that would match our requirements, we'll allocate a new one using `container_allocate_new_page()`. 

.What is the cost of finding an available page?
****
Every time that we need to insert a new (small) item to the container, we need to find a page with enough space for the item. In the worst case, we may need
to scan through the entire free list before we'll find a good location (or allocate a new one). For this reason, we check the `avg_size` if we couldn't fit the
current item into the page. 

The idea is that we check if there is enough space there to fit _another_ value, or if we are better off remove the page from the `free_list` to avoid having
to scan through a lot of pages.
This way, we can assume that for the most part, we'll end up with pages in the `free_list` that has enough space for the items we want to place in the container
and can usually assume that we'll have to through just one page before we find space for the new item.
****

Pages that don't have enough free space are added to the `to_remove` map, which is then passed to `container_remove_full_pages()` for cleanup, as you can see
in <<container_remove_full_pages>>.

[source]
[[container_remove_full_pages]]
.`container.c` - Remove all the pages with no free space from the `free_list`
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_remove_full_pages]
-----

We check if `to_remove` has been initialized and if it has a value, we iterate over all the items in the map and remove them from the `free_list`. Note that the
only impact this has is to remove them from consideration for _new_ items. These pages are going to still be part of the container, hold their data and allow
to do modifications in place (if there is room). 

We remove an item from the `free_list` if it has no available space, but what does _that_ mean? Let's look at <<container_page_can_fit_item_size>> where we 
compute whatever a page has enough free space for our needs and see what is going on.

[source]
[[container_page_can_fit_item_size]]
.`container.c` - Checking whatever a page is a good candidate for a particular item
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_page_can_fit_item_size]
-----

We first check whatever the page metadata shows that we have enough space for the item. If we don't, there is nothing to be done. But even if we _have_ enough
space in the page, it doesn't mean that it is _usable_ space. A pattern of writes and deletes may mean that we have free space in theory, but not in a manner
that help us. 
For that reason, we check the difference between the `floor` and `ceiling` values. If there is enough space for the item, we are done and can allocate the new
item in the page immediately. If there isn't enough space, we'll defrag the page using `container_defrag_page()` before we check again. After calling defrag,
we _should_ have enough space, but there are some pathologic cases that we have to take into account here. It is actually far simply to call defrag on the page
as needed than to try to find available free spot in the page. 
Let's look at how we implement the defrag on a page in <<container_defrag_page>>.

[source]
[[container_defrag_page]]
.`container.c` - De-fragmenting a page to increase usable space.
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_defrag_page]
-----

We start by scanning the `uint16_t* positions` array from the end and trying to see if there are any cleared locations on the end. That allows us to shrink the
size of the `positions` array. We then copy the contents of the page to a temporary buffer and reset the `ceiling` on the page. From there we need to simply
scan the list of entries in the page and copy them one at a time. For each one, we'll "lower" the `ceiling` and then update the position of the entry in the page.

Note that because the item ids that we hand out are the position of the _index_ into the page, defragging the page is something that we can do without any
externally visible change in behavior. That is really important, because otherwise we would need to call out to anyone else that may hold a reference to the `item_id`
of any of the moved items to let them know about the change.

We just went over a lot of code that try to help us use the space from our already existing pages, but eventually we'll run out of all the available space and will
need to allocate a new page. This is shown in <<container_allocate_new_page>>.

[source]
[[container_allocate_new_page]]
.`container.c` - Allocating a new page and wiring it to the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_allocate_new_page]
-----

There are a few interesting things that happen in `container_allocate_new_page()`. We start by allocating the new page and setting up its metadata. As part of that,
we register the newly allocate page in the linked list of container pages by adding it as the next item in the list after the root. This allows us to iterate over
all the pages in the container and thus, over all the items. 

Part of the work that `container_allocate_new_page()` is tasked with is to register the newly allocated page in the `free_list`, so it will be available the next
time we want to allocate space for an item.

=== Reading an item

Now that we have seen how we write an item to the container, let's look at the other side, reading an item from the container. In order to do that, we need to 
get the `item_id` and pass it to `container_item_get()`, shown in <<container_item_get>>.

[source]
[[container_item_get]]
.`container.c` - Reading an item from the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_get]
-----

We use the `item\->item_id` to check if this reference a small or a large item. If this is a large object, the `item_id` is divisible by `PAGE_SIZE` and we can
simply load that page directly. If the `item_id` isn't divisible by `PAGE_SIZE`, we go to the page in question and find the actual position of the value from the `index`. 
The actual page number and the index are computed from the `item_id`, but they should be considered opaque to the callers.

.The `item_id` is an opaque value
****
The `item_id` is, at its core, a reference to a specific location on disk. It is essentially an offset from the start of the file that either points to the real data or 
to another offset to find it. The fact that you know how we generate the `item_id` shouldn't mean that you can do anything with the value.

The `item_id` should be treated as a black box. The only thing that you should be doing with the `item_id` is to pass it back to the `container_*` functions.
****

<<container_item_get>> also has an interesting limit, you can only use it to get items by their public `item_id`. We know that large items actually have two `item_id`. 
The first is to point to the exact page we use for the value, but the second is just a reference to the real `item_id`, and it is stored inside the container page. Why
are we doing this? 

The idea is that a large item has two `item_id`. A public one (divisible by `PAGE_SIZE`), which is returned from the `container_item_put()` and a private one (not
divisible by `PAGE_SIZE`), which store the reference. We use this when we need to iterate over the values, as you can see in <<container_get_next>>.

[source]
[[container_get_next]]
.`container.c` - Iterating over the entries in the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_get_next]
-----

The code in <<container_get_next>> is a bit complex, mostly because we are expected to be called many times and we need to keep state between calls. The idea is that
we'll use the `item_id` to pass the state between calls. The code in `container_get_next()` is tied closely to `container_get_next_item_id()`, which is shown in 
<<container_get_next_item_id>>. The idea is that in `container_get_next_item_id()` we resolve the container page that we are currently on. This can be computed as 
simply as dividing the `item_id` by `PAGE_SIZE` for small items. But we also need to account for large items. In this case, we get the metadata of the large item 
and then get the _private_ `item_id`, which point back to the container page holding the reference. 

Using this method, we are able to iterate over the container without too much of a hassle, even when we have to deal with large items. The `container_get_next_item_id()`
function will increment the `item_id`, because this set us up for the look in `container_get_next()`, where we are looking at the _next_ item. Inside this loop, we check
if the current position points to a large item, in which case we get it from the actual page, or if it is a small item, we just get its size and address.

Note that `varint_decode()` will return the position in the buffer _after_ the integer it decoded. That is where the real value start, which make it very convenient to 
work with it.

=== Deleting an item

After writing and reading, the next task we need to tackle is how we are going to delete an item from the container. This is done using the `container_item_del()` 
function, shown in <<container_item_del>>.

To delete a large item, we get the `container_item_id` from the page metadata and delete that as well. Aside from that tidbit, the process of deleting a
large item mostly consists of calling `txn_free_page()` on the item's `overflow` page. Things gets more interesting when we need to delete a small item. Although, 
interesting might not be the right term. The process of actually deleting a small item consist of setting its' `positions` index to `0` and zeroing the memory for
the item, nothing more. 

The real work is done in `container_item_del_finalize()`. We need to call this function because of two reasons:

* If the page is completely empty, we can simply free the page itself.
* If the page has enough free space, we should register it in the `free_list`. 

Let's see how this is handled in <<container_item_del_finalize>>.

In `container_item_del_finalize()`, we first check if the entire page is free. If this is the case, and if this isn't the first container page, we can just drop it
entirely. We need to remove it from the linked list and the `free_list`, which is done in `container_remove_page()`. 
If the page isn't empty, we check if it has more than enough space for two items. If that is the case, we check if it is already in the `free_list` and if it isn't,
we add it. 
The idea is that in the same manner that failure to add an item to a page will remove an item from the `free_list`, a deletion will add us back. 

Note that we do a little dance with the `header` value. We don't want to modify the container's metadata if we can avoid it, so we'll only call to `txn_modify_metadata()`
on the `header` if we added the page to the hash _and_ the `hash_id` changed. 

The final part of deleting an item from the container is the `container_remove_page()`, shown in <<container_remove_page>>.

.`container.c` - Removing a container page from the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_remove_page]
-----

The `container_remove_page()` function will wire the `next` / `prev` references for the page. Note that while we check if the `next` is set to `0`, we don't need to 
check if `prev` is zeroed. This is because we don't delete the first container page, and that is the only one without a `prev` page.

We also remove the page from the `free_list` and have the same dance around `hash_id_changed` to avoid modifying the metadata of the header if we don't want to.

So far, we covered most of the functionality of the container API, but we are left with the most complex part yet to deal with. The `container_item_update()` 
implementation...

=== Updating an item

Updating an item turns out to be a pretty complex task. On the surface, this doesn't make sense, it would be trivial to implement the update in terms of del and put, 
after all. The key issue with update is that we want, as much as possible, to retain the same `item_id`. In some cases, this is easy. If we are going to write an 
updated value of the same size, there is not going to be any problems. We'll simply overwrite the old value, wherever it may be and the `item_id` will not change.

The complexity starts to creep when we have an update that is of different size that the previous item. In most cases, the size difference when updating an item isn't
that big. We'll typically have very slow growth or decline in the size, so it is still worth it to try to retain the same `item_id`. 

[QUESTION]
.Why is the `item_id` important across updates?
====
We are going to go into a lot of trouble to maintain the `item_id` if at all possible. The question that pops to mind is, why? What is the benefit that we gain from
keeping the same `item_id` across updates?

Let's consider what you'll do with the `item_id`. In most cases, you'll store it in some location. When updating the item, if the `item_id` didn't change, that means
that we don't need to update the stored location. This may seem like nitpicking, but reducing writes is why we have `hash_id_changed` and why I'm spending time trying
to make sure that the `item_id` remains the same. 

A good discussion on the topic is in the blog post: https://eng.uber.com/postgres-to-mysql-migration/[Why Uber Engineering Switched from Postgres to MySQL]. See in 
particular the section about write amplification. Making sure that updates don't change the `item_id` can allow us to skip significant number of cascading updates 
and that is certainly worth it.

In <<container_item_update>>, you can see that `container_item_update()` is mostly about handling the big ticket issues. We check the `item_id` that we need to update
and make if we have a large item, but the new size is too small to fit into a single page all on its own, we'll call to `container_item_replace()`. The same is the case
if we had a small item but the new size is too big to fit into a container page and we need to write to an overflow page. You can see the behavior of `container_item_replace()`
in <<container_item_replace>>.

-----

-----

The `container_item_replace()` function doesn't do much, it will first delete the old value and then put the new one. This is the simplest possible thing that we could
possibly do. Going back to `container_item_update()`, there are two other cases that we have to consider, a large value that is still too large to fit into a container
page and a small value that is still small enough to fit a container page. Let's start looking at `container_item_update_large()` first in <<container_item_update_large>>.

-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_update_large]

In `container_item_update_large()`, we don't care about specific size changes. We care if the number of _pages_ was modified. If the number of pages is the same, we can
simply modify the page, copy the value to the page and zero the remaining buffer to the end of the page. If the number of pages isn't the same, we'll need to call to
`container_item_replace()`. In practice, this means that we'll need to modify the `item_id` in this case only when our size change cross an 8KB boundary.

The handling of small items update is more complex, as you can see in <<container_item_update_small>>. 

[source]
[[container_item_update_small]]
.`container.c` - Updating a small item in the container
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_update_small]
-----

There are two scenarios that we handle in <<container_item_update_small>>. The first is when the size of the item is the same. In this case, we can simply copy it over
the old data and call it a day. If the size is smaller, there isn't much to do either. We write the value (with the prefixed size, of course) to the old location and 
zero the remaining bytes. The space that we aren't using has been lost, but the next defrag will take care of that. 

The implementation gets interesting when we need to take care of a _larger_ size. In this case, we can't just use the existing space, let's look at 
<<container_item_update_small_size_increase>> to see how Gavran is handling this situation.

[[container_item_update_small_size_increase]]
.`container.c` - Find a place to put an item whose size is larger than before
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_item_update_small_size_increase]
-----

We first check if there is enough room in the page for the new size (excluding the old size, of course). If there isn't, we can just replace the value, there is no way
for us to keep the same `item_id`. But even if there is space in the page, this doesn't mean it is available for us. If the space between the `floor` and the `ceiling`
isn't enough, we nee to defrag the page. If there isn't any space even after a defrag, we give up and replace the value.

If there is enough space, either immediately or because of defrag, we can write the new item's data to the top of the `ceiling` and update the `positions` array 
accordingly. The position of the value moved, in this case, but the `item_id` remained the same.

=== Dropping a container

The last topic I want to cover in this chapter is dropping the container. This is similar to dropping a table in a relational database. It is not an action that you do
often, but when you do, you'll like all the resources used by the container to just go away. In this case, the resources are pages in the data file, and we'll need to 
mark all of them as free after dropping the container. You can see how this is implemented in <<container_drop>>.

[source]
[[container_drop]]
.`container.c` - Dropping a container (and its `free_list`) and freeing all their pages
-----
include::./code/container.c[tags=container_drop]
-----

We start the dropping process by calling `hash_drop()` to release any pages held by the `free_list`. We then iterate through the pages in the container, trying to find
any large items. If we find such, we'll free their pages. After we are done with each page, we'll free it in turn. The process completes once we have gone through all of
the pages in the container.

=== Unit tests

As usual, we close our chapter with a few unit tests to verify that the code we wrote actually works. You can also see the API in action in the tests, although I'm more 
focused on verifying the results than beautiful code in the tests.
