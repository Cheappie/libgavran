Files are a wonderful abstraction, a stream of bytes that reside under name, sorted in a hierarcy. Simple enough that a child can use it, powerful enough to be
the motto of an the entire set of operating systems. Everything is a file is one of the defining features of Unix, but it is also an abstraction, and as such, 
it is leaky^[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/].

When building a storage engine, we need to have a pretty good idea about how to manage files. As it turns out, there is a lot of things that are likely wrong 
about how we think about files. The "All File Systems Are Not Created Equal: On the Complexity of Crafting Crash-Consistent 
Applications"^[https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-pillai.pdf] paper tested ten applications (from SQLite to Git to PostgreSQL)
to find whatever they are properly writing to files. 

There are a _lot_ of details that you need to take into account. For example, you may consider that changing a file and then calling `fsync()` will ensure that
the changes to the file are made durable, and that is correct, if you haven't changed the file size. Because while the file data has been flushed, the file 
_metadata_ was not. Which may mean some fun times in the future with the debugger.

LWN has some good articles on the topic of making sure that the data actually reach the disk^[https://lwn.net/Articles/457667/] and the complexities 
invovled^[https://lwn.net/Articles/351422/]. The situation is made more complex by the fact that this is depend on what OS and file system you use and 
even what _mode_ you used to mount a particular drive. As the author of a storage engine, you have to deal with these details in either of two ways:

* Specify explicitly the support configuration, raise hell if user is attempting to use on non supported configuration.
* Make it work across the board. Much harder than it sounds, but not impossible.

Because working with files is such a huge complex mess, and because it is _different_ across operating systems, we'll hide this complexity behind a
platform abstraction layer (PAL). Listing 2.1 shows the core functions that the PAL expose.

```{caption="High level to mask platform difference when working with files" .c}
typedef struct pal_file_handle file_handle_t;

size_t get_file_handle_size(const char* path, 
		const char* name);
MUST_CHECK bool create_file(const char* path, 
		const char* name, file_handle_t* handle);
MUST_CHECK bool ensure_file_minimum_size(
		file_handle_t* handle, uint64_t minimum_size);
MUST_CHECK bool close_file(file_handle_t* handle);
```

We define an opaque type `file_handle_t`, which is how we'll communicate about files with the PAL. If you are used to C APIs, you might notice something
interesting, the API shown in Listing 2.1 is not doing any memory allocations. The API can fail (invalid file name, wrong permissions, etc), but it won't
have to deal with memory issues. Instead, we ask that the _caller_ will provide us with the memory for the `file_handle_t`. Typical usage of the API 
is shown in Listing 2.2.

```{caption="Using the PAL API to create a file and set its size, then close it"}
int main () {
   size_t size = get_file_handle_size("db", "phones");
   file_handle_t* handle = malloc(size);
   if(!handle)
      return ENOMEM;
   if(!create_file("db", "phones", handle) || 
   	  !ensure_file_minimum_size(handle, 128 * 1024) || 
   	  !close_file(handle)
   	  ) {
	      print_all_errors();
	      return EIO;
   }
   free(handle);
   return 0;
}
```

This code should ensure that at the end of the way, we have a file that has a minimum size of 128KB which will retain its size even in the case of an error or
a system crash. That sounds easy enough to do in theory, but require some dancing around to get to it. Right now I'm going to focus on Linux as the implementation
system, but we'll get to other sytems down the line. 

The `bool` result and the ability to chain such commands makes for nice API, but we do need to be careful about freeing the `handle` that we allocated. Listing 2.2 
has a memory leak where the `handle` will never be freed if we have an I/O error. In this case, we can fix without too much trouble, but in more complex cases, that
can get _really_ complex. Requiring the use of `goto`, multiple state flags, etc. 

A better option is to use the `__attribute((cleanup))__` option, avaialble in Clang and GCC for handling this scenario by ensuring that a function will be called when
a variable goes out of scope. That would allow to implement a `defer` like functionality in C. Listing 2.3 shows how that can be made to work:

```{caption="Using defer to avoid a memory leak"}
#define defer(func, var) void* \
   __defer ## __LINE__ __attribute__ \
   ((__cleanup__(func))) = var; \
   (void)__defer ## __LINE__ 

int main () {

   size_t size = get_file_handle_size("db", "phones");
   file_handle_t* handle = malloc(size);
   if(!handle)
      return ENOMEM;
   defer(free, handle);
   if(!create_file("db", "phones", handle) || 
   	  !ensure_file_minimum_size(handle, 128 * 1024) || 
   	  !close_file(handle)
   	  ) {
	      print_all_errors();
	      return EIO;
   }
   return 0;
}
```

The `defer` macro ensures that the `free` function is called regardless of how we exit the function. Of course, this is a very weak form of `defer`, we can only use 
that on pointers and the method we register must accept a `void*` argument. That is good enough for now for me to keep wanting it around. We'll see how it fits into
the codebase. One thing to note here, however, is that accepting this `defer` means that we won't be able to compile using MSVC, since it has no similar feature. 

### Creating a file

The act of creating a file is a non trivial operation, since we need to make sure that the file creation is atomic and durable.
